Autocomplete
============

Created in Spring 2018 at UC San Diego for CSE 100

This program builds a custom Multiway Trie structure that takes in a list of strings. Based on the frequencies of the strings, the program will generate suggestions to a string prefix that the user inputs. Another file randomly generates a text document based on the same idea of using frequencies of a given list of strings.
